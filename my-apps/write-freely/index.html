<h2 class="boldFont SubSectionHeaderFont">About</h2>
<p class="boldFont SubSectionHeaderFont">Write Freely is a creativity app that helps you master the art of free writing. It does this by eliminating your ability to perform any edits while you write. Backspace, delete, undo, overwrite, and all known means of editing have been disabled. You might find this frustrating at first, but as you train your mind to let go of the urge to edit your creativity will be unleashed.</p>
<p class="boldFont SubSectionHeaderFont">Write Freely is at this time my most 'successful' app. While it's download count is negligible, its sales and conversion rates have been pretty good. Â This was my first time using WinJS for an app. I really liked using CSS to style things vs XAML. I kind of wish I could write the UI in all WinJS and the logic in C#.</p>
