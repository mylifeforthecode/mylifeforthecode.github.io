<p>One of the ceremonies of the Ludum Dare competition is to jump on the website and write a post letting everyone know you are going to be in for the competition. In part, this gives you a chance to let everyone know about any custom code you are going to be using and where to find it so others have a chance to use it if they want. This is part of the rules for the 48hr compo. However, it is mostly just fun to let everyone know you're competing. I submitted my obligatory post just a few moments ago. You can check it out here:</p>

<p>I had planned on doing a post about creating a game with the framework I am building, but time ran out to get a blog post in this week. That being said, I'll probably have a post like that ready for tomorrow or the next day.</p>
<p>Just something fun to share :-)</p>
