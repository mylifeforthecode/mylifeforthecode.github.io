<p>Despite feeling a bit sick and tired tonight, I was inspired by one of the things one of my guests said in an interview and I powered through my discomfort toÂ put together a little sneak peek of the My Life For The Code Podcast that I will be releasing to the world on <strong>June 29th, 2015</strong>.</p>
<p>In this sneak peek I share a few short clips from my initial 4 podcasts. Let me know what you think in the comments below! :-)</p>

<p>One thing I learned while putting this together, "Peek" and "Peak" are two different words. Check <a href="http://theoatmeal.com/comics/sneak_peek">this</a> out for a great illustration of the difference.</p>
<p>If you are a software developer that is excited about something you are doing and would like to share your story please drop me an email at <a href="mailto:shawn@mylifeforthecode.com">shawn@mylifeforthecode.com</a>. I'd also be up to start a mastermind group if anyone is looking to start one :-).</p>
