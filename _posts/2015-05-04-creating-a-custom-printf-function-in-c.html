<p>When I first started writing C code I riddled my code with a bunch of printf statements to log information for debugging purposes. When I did this I found myself writing a lot of boilerplate code over and over again. For example, the format string of my printf always ended with a '\n' newline character, and I wished there as a way I could skip having to type those two characters over and over again. Luckily I was able to make my wish come true. As I learned more about C I discovered that it gives you the ability to write custom printf style functions and it is a real easy thing to do.</p>
<p>To get started, you should include the &lt;stdio.h&gt; and &lt;stdarg.h&gt; libraries:</p>
<pre>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

#include &lt;stdarg.h&gt;</pre>
<p>The &lt;stdarg.h&gt; library gives you the structures needed to accept a variable number of arguments to the end of your function, as printf does. The &lt;stdio.h&gt; library gives you the 'vprintf' and related function that accept the variable argument structures for printing.</p>
<p>A custom printf function should have in its signature a const char pointer to the format you want printed and a set of ellipses as the last parameter:</p>
<pre>void log(const char *format, ...);</pre>
<p>The ellipses indicate the function accepts a variable number of arguments. The basic definition will look something like this:</p>
<pre>void log(const char *format, ...)

{

    va_list vargs;

    va_start(vargs, format);

    vprintf(format, vargs);

    printf("\n");

    va_end(vargs);

}</pre>
<p>va_list is a pointer type that the variable arguments list is assigned to and cleaned up by the va_start and va_end functions. After calling va_start on the 'vargs' variable it will point to the variable parameters passed to it. vprintf is a special function that accepts the format and va_list and performs the standard printf operation.</p>
<p>Note that stdio.h also contains a vfprintf functions that will allow you to print to file or a standard stream such as stderr.</p>
