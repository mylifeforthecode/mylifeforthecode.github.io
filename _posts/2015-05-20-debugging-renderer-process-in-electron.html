<p>I finally figured out how to load up the DevTools in Electron to debug a renderer process. I don't know why it took me so long to find this, but I inspected the source code of another project that uses Electron and finally stumbled upon the following line in the main.js process:</p>
<pre>mainWindow.openDevTools();</pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After you have created your BrowserWindow, if you call openDevTools() you get the same tools you get when you hit F12 in Chrome as you can see here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mylifeforthecode.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Capture8.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-296" src="http://www.mylifeforthecode.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Capture8.png" alt="Capture" width="800" height="600" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you have these tools open you can set break points in your JavaScript and refresh the page using F5. This gives me the minimum functionality I need to debug things in renderer processes.</p>
<p>I am certain there is probably a way to attach the debugger in Visual Studio Code to the JS executing in a renderer processes, but I haven't quite figured that out yet.  Let me know if you have any solutions for me! :)</p>
