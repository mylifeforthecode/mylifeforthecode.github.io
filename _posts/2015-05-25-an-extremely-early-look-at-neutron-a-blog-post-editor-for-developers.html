<p>I have been learning the heck out of the Electron shell lately because I have a project I want to build. Today I finally hacked out a rough prototype of this project and I thought I would share it.</p>
<h3>The Problem</h3>
<p>I am currently using the standard WordPress editor to write my blog posts. One of the issues I run into with writing my blog posts is formatting and changing code. I once started a blog post with some C code in it and the angle brackets in #include &lt;stdio.h&gt; kept disappearing. What is worse is that the Tab key in the WordPress take you outside the editor which is a hassle when you are trying to adjust formatting in code. I need to find something better.</p>
<p>Now I know LiveWriter is probably a worthwhile alternative, but I would really like a clean minimalist interface to boot. Live writer is certainly not that. Also, screw WYSIWYG. I use to maintain wiki posts at work and I always preferred the plain text mode.</p>
<h3>What is Neutron</h3>
<p>Neutron is an editor I am building to solve these problems. Here are the core features I plan to implement with Neutron:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Inline code editing for snippets, </strong>this is the core feature I am looking for</li>
<li>Distraction free writing, clean minimal interface</li>
<li>Editing will be done with GitHub flavor markdown with syntax highlighting</li>
<li>Preview mode to view styled output, potentially pulling in theme from WordPress</li>
<li>Integrate with WordPress and allow you to publish directly from the editor to your blog</li>
</ol>
<p>Neutron is being built on Electron allowing it to be cross-platform. The initial release will be Windows. I am not sure what the pricing model will look like. To be honest, I am not sure anyone else will want such a thing. Luckily this project scratches my own itch so even if I take a long time developing it I will benefit from it in the end.</p>
<h3>A Look At The Prototype</h3>
<p>I recorded a screen cast of Neutron demonstrating a prototype of the core feature that I want, inline code editing. I have a long ways to go before Neutron will be ready, but after getting to this point I am excited to continue work on it...</p>

<p>I know it doesn't look like much, but I am pretty excited about where I can take this thing.</p>
