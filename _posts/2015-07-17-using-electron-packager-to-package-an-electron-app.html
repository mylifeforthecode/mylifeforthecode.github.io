<p>I wrote an article a month or two ago called <a href="http://www.mylifeforthecode.com/creating-a-windows-distribution-of-an-electron-app-using-squirrel/">Creating a Windows Distribution of an Electron App using Squirrel</a>. In it I manually gathered the pieces I needed to create the package to be distributed and hack the executable's resources by hand. This was cumbersome and I recently learned there is a pretty cool project called <a href="https://github.com/maxogden/electron-packager">electron-packager</a> that will do a lot of this for you. I took it for a spin tonight.</p>
<h4>Get Electron-Packager</h4>
<p>With the beauty of most things that are Node, electron-packager is available via npm. Here is the command to get it:</p>
<pre><code>npm i electron-packager -g

</code></pre>
<p>Of course, this can also be saved to the development work space if needed.</p>
<h4>Use Electron-Packager</h4>
<p>In <a href="http://www.mylifeforthecode.com/creating-a-windows-distribution-of-an-electron-app-using-squirrel/">Creating a Windows Distribution of an Electron App using Squirrel</a> I have you create a 'Staging' to load everything into. Without worrying about resources hacking or copying and pasting here is the command I would to have electron-packager do the heavy lifting:</p>
<pre>electron-packager &lt;dir&gt; &lt;app_name&gt; --platform=win32 --arch=all --version=&lt;electron_version&gt; --icon=&lt;path_to_icon&gt; --out=Staging --version-string.CompanyName=&lt;my_company_name&gt;--version-string.ProductName=&lt;my_product_name&gt; --version-string.ProductVersion=&lt;product_version&gt;</pre>
<p>Here is a bit of a break down:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>&lt;dir&gt;</em></strong> replace this with the path to your app folder.</li>
<li><em><strong>&lt;app_name&gt;</strong> </em>this is the name of your app.</li>
<li><strong>--platform=win32</strong> you can build for all platforms, but I only run Windows at the moment so that is all I built for. This is required.</li>
<li><strong>--arch=all</strong> you can choose to build for 32 bit or 64 bit or both. I just went with all.</li>
<li><strong>--version=</strong><em><strong>&lt;electron_version&gt;</strong> </em>replace with the version of Electron you want to use.</li>
<li><strong>--icon=</strong><em><strong>&lt;path_to_icon&gt;</strong> </em>provide the path to the .ico file you want to use, placed in the .exe's resources.</li>
<li><strong>--out=Staging</strong> where you want the output to go, i chose staging.</li>
<li><strong>--version-string.CompanyName=<em>&lt;my_company_name&gt; </em></strong>puts your company name in the Version Info resources of the executable.</li>
<li><strong>--version-string.ProductName=<em>&lt;my_product_name&gt; </em></strong>puts the name of the product into the Version Info resources of the executable.</li>
<li><strong>--version-string.ProductVersion=<em>&lt;product_version&gt; </em></strong>puts your product version in the Version Info resources of the executable.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you are done running the command folders of form -- are created. If you are creating a package for Squirrel.Windows you'll want to make sure you update the .nuspec file to point to the new directories created by electron-packager.</p>
<p>Sorry I did not go in-depth on this. The documentation for electron-packager is pretty self-explanatory. Check out the full documentation for electron-packager here: <a href="https://github.com/maxogden/electron-packager">https://github.com/maxogden/electron-packager</a></p>
