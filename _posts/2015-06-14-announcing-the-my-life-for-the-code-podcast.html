<p>I've been throwing around the idea of starting a podcast for the last few months and I have finally decided to pull the trigger on it. Today I am announcing that I will be launching the My Life For The Code podcast on<strong> June 29th, 2015</strong>.</p>
<p>I recorded a little promotional audio about the podcast that you can listen to here:</p>
<p><audio controls='controls' src='http://traffic.libsyn.com/mylifeforthecode/promo.mp3'></audio></p>
<p>I will be interviewing software developers or others in the software space that are currently doing something they are passionate about with the hope to inspire those of you who are stuck doing things you hate everyday to find something you too can get excited about.</p>
<p>You're going to hear stories about my guest's first experiences with writing code, the journey that got them to where they are today, and what it is today that makes them excited they got into software development in the first place. I'll also try to extract some tips and tricks that you can use on your journey.</p>
<p>I'm really excited to get going on this. Episodes will be 20 to 40 minutes in length and will be released every Monday starting June 29th. I have a great line of up initial guests and I hope you'll consider checking this new podcast out on the 29th!</p>
<p>P.S. If you are a software developer that is excited about something you are doing and would like to share your story please drop me an email at <a href="mailto:shawn@mylifeforthecode.com">shawn@mylifeforthecode.com</a>.</p>
