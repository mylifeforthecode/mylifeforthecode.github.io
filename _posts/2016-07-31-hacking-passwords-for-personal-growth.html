<p>He he, hacking passwords... sorry, this post is not about techniques for breaking into other people's accounts. This post is about a life hack a coworker of mine recently included in a presentation. I thought it was quite good, and found my inner self compelled to share it with you. I also thought putting "hacking passwords" in the title would be clever... please correct me if this is not so.</p>
<p>Anyways, my coworker's talk was on improving productivity. One of the tips was called "Go Stuart Smalley on your password". For those who do not already know the reference, Stuart Smalley is a character created by Al Franken for the show Saturday Night Live, He is a bit of a caricature of a self-help guru, and is famous for his portrayal of daily affirmation... "Because I'm good enough, I'm smart enough, and doggone it people like me..."</p>

<p>I've had an interest in daily affirmations since reading Scott Adams' book, <a href="http://amzn.to/2aa36j3">How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big</a>. I really enjoy the way Scott hypothesizes that affirmations may be a way to break into the source code of the mind and reprogram things. I tried them for a bit, but failed to stick with it.</p>
<p>My coworker's tip was to use an affirmation for a password, allowing you to pick up work on a high note. I found this to be quite a novel concept considering password entry is, at least for me, a small, frustrating task I have to deal with every day. Hacking this process to improve your life is, at least to my mind, something worthy of consideration. Furthermore, using a full affirmation as a password will probably leave you with one of the most secure passwords you've ever had.</p>
<p>These affirmations may be positive thoughts about yourself, IAmAn@wesomeDeve1oper, IRock@Programming, etc, but I think a more powerful tactic would instead target something you want to achieve within a relatively short period of time. Doing so takes advantage of company policies of changing your passwords every 90 days or so. IWillWriteAnE-book, IWillLoose10Pounds, or IWillRunA10k are all things come to mind as short-term goals you could focus on for the duration the password. You could even pair this with the common strategy of increment a number within your password.. IWillRun1MileAWeek, IWillRun2MilesAWeek, IWillRun3MilesAWeek... increasing it every time your password expires.</p>
<p>Re-framing life's little annoyances is a powerful thing. Next password change I'm going to give this little hack a try. It leaves me wondering what other little things I've been annoyed with everyday that I could use to improve my life.</p>
