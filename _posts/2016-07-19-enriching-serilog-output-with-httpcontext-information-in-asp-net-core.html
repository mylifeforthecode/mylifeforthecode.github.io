<p>I was working a bit with ASP.NET Core this week and I learned an interesting thing about HttpContext in this new world. Older versions of HttpContext provided the static property "Current" which, consistent with the nature of a static property, you could access from anywhere in the application. In ASP.NET Core this was replaced by IHttpContextAccessor. I think this is a good thing since I am, personally, not a huge fan of accessing things I don't inject myself. However...</p>
<p>I learned this because I was attempting to create an outputTemplate in Serilog that would decorate every log entry with the ID of the current session using a custom Enricher like this one here: <a href="https://github.com/serilog-web/classic/blob/master/src/SerilogWeb.Classic/Classic/Enrichers/HttpSessionIdEnricher.cs">https://github.com/serilog-web/classic/blob/master/src/SerilogWeb.Classic/Classic/Enrichers/HttpSessionIdEnricher.cs</a>. My head dropped with a big DUH! when I realized I couldn't access HttpContext directly. Soon enough, the minor defeat gave way to the "what I am going to do now" question and I dug a bit deeper.</p>
<p>My immediate thought was to use IHttpContextAccessor since it is advertised as HttpContext.Current's hipper replacement. However, I hit a roadblock (probably just a mental one) when I remembered that the Serilog logger was being configured in the Startup class's constructor, prior to registering services where I'd have stuff to inject, meaning I would not have access to IHttpContextAccessor without changing around how and where Serilog was being configured, which I didn't want to do. A real pickle right?</p>
<p>Luckily enough I found that there is a builtin fixture to Serilog called LogContext which allows you to push and pop values to create an enriched context for logging (aptly named, am I right?). If you combine this tool with some custom ASP.NET Middleware (which I learned to do from this post: <a href="https://www.exceptionnotfound.net/writing-custom-middleware-in-asp-net-core-1-0/">https://www.exceptionnotfound.net/writing-custom-middleware-in-asp-net-core-1-0/</a>) you can easily enrich a Serilog log with information from the HttpContext.</p>
<p>To demonstrate, let's suppose you want to log the address of every incoming request in every log. You may setup the Log in Serilog like this:</p>
<p>{% gist 78506962a24580b04f591cabb24a9727 %}</p>
<p>Serilog will look for a "Address" value to replace "{Address}" with in the the log, which is what we want, but we have to provide this to it. This is done via middleware and LogContext like so:</p>
<p>{% gist.github.com b37ff816285dc98139604070aa30497c %}</p>
<p>Now if you add a logging call to your controller you can see the IP address is populated in log as expected. Here's a screenshot of my own tribulation proving this works:</p>

<p>Take a look at my full example on GitHub here: <a href="https://github.com/srakowski/serilog-httpcontext-example">https://github.com/srakowski/serilog-httpcontext-example</a></p>
<p>I'm guessing there is a better way to do this, but, hey, it works! Thanks for reading :)</p>
