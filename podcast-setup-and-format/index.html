<p>Thank you for agreeing to be a guest on my podcast! Below is some general setup information and the format of the interview. Please <a href="mailto://shawn@mylifeforthecode.com">contact me</a> if you have any questions.</p>
<h4>Setup</h4>
<p>Interviews take about 1 hour to record and are generally done over Skype. If Skype will not work for you let me know ASAP so that I can arrange an alternate platform to conduct the interview over. You can add me on Skype using the email address: srakowski@live.com</p>
<p>While I will be recording the Skype conversation, I also ask that you please record your end of the conversation using <a href="http://audacityteam.org/">Audacity </a>or some other audio recording software. I combine your recording with a recording of my side and sync the tracks using the Skype recording. This drastically improves the quality of the audio and protects against audio loss if Skype drops for short periods. Some audio recording programs will pull in the my Skype channel instead of your mic. Consider using the Echo / Sound Test contact in Skype to record a conversation and ensure that only your side of the conversation is recorded. Save your recording as a .WAV file, preferably, or any other format that can be imported into Audacity.</p>
<p>To allow for a smooth conversation, please wear earbuds or headphones during the recording otherwise your mic will pickup my voice and echo will occur. (This happened in one interview, it was not pretty! :-)).</p>
<p>When the podcast is over please send me the audio file you have recorded via DropBox or OneDrive along with any links or resources we talked about that I might have trouble locating on the web.</p>
<p>I will be editing out any swear words, so it is okay if you accidentally let one slip, but please try not to! :-)</p>
<h4>Interview Format - Experienced Software Developers</h4>
<p>Effective: April 13th, 2016</p>
<p>I will start the podcast introducing you as my guest. Something along the lines of "Hello and welcome to the My Life For The Code podcast! Today I am excited to be joined by &lt;your full name&gt;. &lt;your first name&gt; is a..." followed by a few words that best describe you. Examples: software developer, husband/wife, mother/father, kung fu enthusiast, CTO of X, founder of project Y, advocate for cause Z, chess master, etc... whatever is consistent with your personal branding. I can also pull this from Twitter or your blog if you have something already written.</p>
<p>I will then ask you to say hello and tell me a little more about yourself and what kinds of things you are working on today.</p>
<p>When it seems appropriate to transition, I will ask you to tell me the story of your first experiences programming. I'll call this your "Hello World" moment. Things to consider talking about in your story: What prompted you to write your first program? What language was it? What computer system was it on? Did you build anything really fun or cool? What was it about this experience that drove you to make software development a major part of your life?</p>
<p>Once we get a good idea of how you got your start in programming I will ask you to tell a few stories about your journey from those early days of programming to what you are doing today. In this section, I'd like you to share at least one story that is a high point for you and one story that is a low point in your journey.</p>
<p>After hearing a few stories, I'll ask you what advice you would give yourself if you were starting out as a software developer today.</p>
<p>Next, I will ask you to discuss the things you are working on today that have you most excited. In many cases this may be the meat of the interview, especially if I may have contacted you with a particular topic in mind.</p>
<p>When it seems appropriate to transaction I will ask you to share with the audience something that you enjoy outside of software development. Examples: Brazilian jiu-jisu, running, gaming, spending time with family, geocaching, fishing, playing music, etc... Depending on your response I may ask if this side passion has ever influenced you as a software developer.</p>
<p>When we start to run out of time I will ask you a series of short questions to give the audience some tips and advice:</p>
<ol>
<li>What is one book, podcast, YouTube channel, or any other source of information that has greatly influenced you that you would suggest every software developer look into? NOTE: this does not necessarily need to be software related.</li>
<li>What is one old, fringe, or emerging technology/framework/language that you would like to learn if you had all the time in the world and unlimited resources?</li>
<li>What is one resource or tool that you use to make you a better developer or a more productive person? (Please refrain from answering with OneNote or Evernote).</li>
<li>&lt;A question from a previous guest&gt;. I will email you this question ahead of the interview if I know it.</li>
<li>What is a question you would like me to ask a future guest of the podcast?</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, I will thank you for being my guest and ask you what the best way for people to get in touch with you if they have any questions or thoughts.</p>
<h4>Interview Format - Developers At The Start of Their Career</h4>
<p>Effective: March 24th, 2016</p>
<p>I will start the podcast introducing you as my guest. Something along the lines of "Hello and welcome to the My Life For The Code podcast! Today I am excited to be joined by &lt;your full name&gt;. &lt;your first name&gt; is a..." followed by a few words that best describe you. Examples: software developer, husband/wife, mother/father, kung fu enthusiast, CTO of X, founder of project Y, advocate for cause Z, chess master, etc... whatever is consistent with your personal branding.

What was it about this experience that drove you to make software development a major part of your life?</p>
<p>When it seems appropriate to transition I will ask you about what you are currently doing as a software developer OR what your plans are. The point here is to get a sense of where you are at in your career.</p>
<p>Next I'll ask you a series of questions that I hope will create some discussion. I may some or all of them depending on how much we discuss. If you have a preference to answer some and not others please let me know. The questions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>What has been the most fun or interesting project or thing you've created?</li>
<li>What is your favorite thing about software development?</li>
<li>What is your least favorite thing?</li>
<li>What is something you hope to accomplish in your career as a software developer?</li>
<li>As you are just starting out as a software developer, what advice do you have for others who are about to jump in?</li>
<li>Give me a prediction you have for the future of software development.</li>
<li>Do you have a question or advice you would like to ask me? (Don't be too hard on me!)</li>
</ul>
<p>When it seems appropriate to transaction I will ask you to share with the audience something that you enjoy outside of software development. Examples: Brazilian jiu-jisu, running, gaming, spending time with family, geocaching, fishing, playing music, etc... Depending on your response I may ask if this side passion has ever influenced you as a software developer.</p>
<p>When all the questions are asked or we run out of time I'll ask you the following questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Name something that you've discovered in your short history of a developer that has either heavily influenced you as a developer (i.e. books, podcasts, etc) or has made you more productive as a developer (i.e. tools, life-hacks).</li>
<li>What is one old, fringe, or emerging technology/framework/language that you would like to learn if you had all the time in the world and unlimited resources?</li>
<li>&lt;A question from a previous guest&gt;. I will email you this question ahead of the interview if I know it.</li>
<li>What is a question you would like me to ask a future guest of the podcast.</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, I will thank you for being my guest and ask you what the best way for people to get in touch with you if they have any questions or thoughts.</p>
<h4>A Final Note</h4>
<p>I really appreciate you taking the time to interview with me. If there is any way I can return the favor and help you with something please do not hesitate to ask. Without awesome guests like you the My Life For The Code podcast would not exist. Thank you! :-)</p>
