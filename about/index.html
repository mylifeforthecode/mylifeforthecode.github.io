<p>Hello! My name is Shawn Rakowski and welcome to my blog! I am a father, husband, programmer, blogger, and podcaster. I have an affinity for software development and the people in it, and would like to help as many people as I can to find happiness in this space.</p>
<p>I earned a B.S. in Co<img class=" wp-image-464 size-medium alignleft" src="http://www.mylifeforthecode.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/shawn-300x289.png" alt="" width="300" height="289" />mputer Science and a B.A. in Philosophy from Bemidji State University in 2009. Since then I have been working as a software engineer and technical recruiter.</p>
<p>Being on the job since I graduated, I have come to the conclusion that my distaste for processes and rules means I am probably not going to be happy with most of the jobs in the corporate world.</p>
<p>I am currently pursuing failure in hopes of one day succeeding at something and escaping life in the corporate world forever. In 2015 I created a podcast to help encourage software developers who have hit a low point to rise up and find something that brings back their enjoyment of programming. The people I interviewed had great stories to tell and are inspiring to me. I hope they inspire you too! I may bring this back in the future, but I'm focusing on other things at the moment.</p>
<p>Thanks for visiting my blog, and feel free to contact me with any questions or comments. My email address is <a href="mailto:shawn@mylifeforthecode.com">shawn@mylifeforthecode.com</a>.</p>
<p>Until the glorious day that I am my own boss the views here are my own and do not necessarily reflect the views of my employer.</p>
